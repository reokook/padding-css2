    <h2> Piece by Piece to Mastery</h2>
    <div>"Learning to code is like solving a puzzle. Each piece, whether it’s 
        HTML, CSS, or JavaScript connect to build a complete picture. With 
        consistent practice and curiosity, anyone can create something amazing. 
        Start small, but dream big, and remember, every expert was once a 
        beginner." 
Coding is not just about writing lines of syntax; it’s about unlocking 
        creativity and solving real-world problems. By understanding the 
        building blocks of programming, you gain the power to turn ideas into 
        reality. Stay persistent, embrace challenges, and celebrate each 
        milestone as you grow into a confident and capable coder. </div>
